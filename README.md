# questlines

An app to build quest lines for organized and trackable self-learning goals.

This was made to look at self-learning like a Civilization "tech tree", where complex topics
have prerequisites on multiple simpler topics in different disciplines.

There's probably an application out there for easy "skill tree" or "questline" building like this,
but I couldn't find one and would rather learn some more by building it myself.

This is kind of a prototype for a future task tracking application I have in mind and want
to work out the details on deploying a single Go+Vue.js binary for self-hosting.
